# Lab 2 -  Intro to stan

## Excercise 1 - generated quantities
1. Compile code_1.stan and sample from it using N=F (number of letters in first name)
2. Create a pandas dataframe from resulting draws.
3. Plot a histogram for each of theta and lambda

## Excercise 2 - constraints on the data
1. Observe how constraints on data behave for code_2 and code_3
